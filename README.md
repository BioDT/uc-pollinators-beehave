# Beehave model for BioDT Pollinators pDT

Please see the [BEEHAVE website](https://beehave-model.net/) for
more information about the BEEHAVE model (model description and manual).

The model version "Beehave_BeeMapp2015_Netlogo6version_PolygonAggregation.nlogo" by JÃ¼rgen Groeneveld (Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research - UFZ) is a modification of the BeeMapp2015.nlogo. Beehave (2013) and Beehave_BeeMapp (2015) are implementations of the model BEEHAVE, developed by Matthias Becher and colleagues:

Becher, M.A., Grimm, V., Thorbek, P., Horn, J., Kennedy, P.J. & Osborne, J.L. (2013) BEEHAVE: A systems model of honeybee colony dynamics and foraging to explore multifactorial causes of colony failure. Journal of Applied Ecology.

This implementation is based on the software platform NetLogo (Wilensky, U. 1999. NetLogo, http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/. Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling, Northwestern Universtity, Evanston, IL.), and can be downloaded for free from http://beehave-model.net/.

Beehave_BeeMapp2015_Netlogo6version_PolygonAggregation.nlogo has been modified that its running under NetLogo 6.2. In addition, the names of the input files have been made global variables to allow for workflows executing many instances of BEEHAVE using different input files.

The Beehave_BeeMapp2015 model (Copyright 2015 by Matthias Becher) and the modified version Beehave_BeeMapp2015_Netlogo6version_PolygonAggregation.nlogo comes with the Copyright and Licence Information:
